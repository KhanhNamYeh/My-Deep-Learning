# Basic Deep Learning Project

This project is created for **revision, self-learning, and exploration of fundamental deep learning model architectures**.  
The main goal is to **understand how core deep learning models work from the ground up**, rather than only using high-level APIs.

The repository is intended to be **open, educational, and widely accessible** for students and beginners who want to learn deep learning in a structured and practical way.

## Project Objectives

- Review fundamental concepts of Deep Learning
- Understand model architectures by **building them from scratch**
- Explore and re-implement **well-known deep learning models**
- Compare **manual implementations vs framework-based implementations**
- Serve as a **learning reference** for the community

---

##  Project Structure

The project consists of **three main parts**:

### 1️ Build Basic Models from Scratch
- Implement core neural network components manually
- Focus on:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backward propagation (gradient computation)
  - Loss functions
  - Optimization algorithms
- No deep learning frameworks (or minimal usage), just numpy

This part helps build **strong intuition** about how neural networks actually work internally.

---

### 2️ Rebuild Famous Deep Learning Models with PyTorch
- Re-implement popular architectures using **PyTorch**
- Focus on:
  - Model architecture design
  - Training and evaluation pipeline
  - Hyperparameter experimentation
- Models may include:
  - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) | AlexNet, will update more
  - RNN / LSTM | will update
  - Transformers | hope done before 2026
  - More ...

This part connects **theory to practical, industry-standard tools**.

--- 

### 3️ Applications with Real-World Datasets

This part focuses on **applying deep learning models to real-world datasets** in order to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

The main objectives of this section are:
- Work with **real, noisy, and imperfect data**
- Perform **data preprocessing and feature engineering**
- Observe common issues such as:
  - Overfitting / underfitting
  - Data imbalance
  - Noise and missing values
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics

## Notes

- The project is continuously updated as new models and experiments are added
- Code is written with clarity and educational value in mind
- Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome
